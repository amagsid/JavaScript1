// exercise 3 : log the number

// step 1 declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it 
let numberX;
// step 2  declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it 
console.log('I think value of x is undefined');  //I initially wrote a random number instead of "undefined" here but then it didn't make sense to me since we are asked to write another statement of what we think the value is in step number 5
// step 3 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.
console.log(numberX);
// step 4 initialize variable numberX with a number
numberX = 42;
// step 5 add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of numberX is
console.log("looks like the value of x is 42 'pwdlstouchalso called an integer'");
// step 6 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX
console.log(numberX);
